veg momos recipe â€“ posting one of the popular tibetan recipe of vegetable momos made from scratch :-)

preparing momos takes quite a good amount of time. so when you have enough time to spare, then make the momos. if you have a helping hand, then the time will reduce. but if you do everything on your own, it takes about 1.5 to 2 hrs, depending on your working speed and the gadgets you have in your kitchen.

now coming to momos, i have had one of the best momos or call them dim sum in the mainland china restaurant. back then i did not know that momos would become a popular street food in north of india. a few years back when we lived in gurgaon, i was amazed to see momos as a street food snack in many places.

when living in goa, a restaurant just a few kilometers from our place, specialized only in momos and that too different kinds with various stuffings. the ownerâ€™s wife was a tibetan and she would prepare the momos. the sauce they used to serve with the momos was a spicy, hot sauce and damn good. unfortunately, i donâ€™t know the recipe as i never asked the tibetan lady ðŸ˜‰

so when i made these momos, i had to serve them with a spicy sauce. i chose to serve the veg momos with schezwan sauce. i donâ€™t make a spicy filling for the momos. i keep the vegetable filling balanced in taste and lightly spiced, so that it accompanies the spicy & hot sauce very well. at home we love steamed momos over the fried ones. so this recipe is of steamed momos.

the shaping of the momos come through practice. i donâ€™t make momos often. hence obviously, i am not an expert in shaping them. but i do make a decent job of it. i have shared two ways of shaping momos in the step by step pics below. choose the easy one or if you are courageous, then move on to the making the pleated momos.
